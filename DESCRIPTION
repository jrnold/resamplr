Description: Additional resampling methods for the 'resampler' class in the 'modelr' package.
  Resampling and similar methods implemented include: bootstrap methods (simple bootstrap,
  weighted bootstrap, balanced bootstrap, moving-blocks bootstrap),
  test-training splits, cross-validation (leave-one-out, leave-p-out, 
  k-fold, time-series k-fold, time series rolling windows),
  jackknife (delete-one and delete-p), permutations, and rolling windows.
  These are implemented as generic functions which include a grouped data method
  that implements group-wise or stratified versions of all the above.
